## Modifying Gameplay: Example with "Prince" Difficulty

To modify the "Prince" difficulty AI, focus on the `Difficulties` table. You can change the `DifficultyType` and `Name` fields to adjust the settings for the "Prince" difficulty. For example, you might want to change the `SortIndex` to alter its position in the difficulty list or adjust other game parameters associated with this difficulty level.

### Steps to Modify:
1. Locate the entry in the `Difficulties` table where `DifficultyType` is set to "Prince".
2. Update the `Name` field if you want to change how it appears in the game.
3. Adjust the `SortIndex` to change its order relative to other difficulties.
4. Consider adding or modifying related entries in other tables that might affect AI behavior or game settings specific to the "Prince" difficulty.

By understanding and utilizing the tables in `AdditionalTables.sql`, you can customize various aspects of Civilization VI to enhance your gaming experience.
