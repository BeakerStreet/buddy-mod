# Project Overview

## Vision
This mod aims to revolutionize the AI in the game by making it mimic real human player behavior. The ultimate goal is to have the Prince AI outperform the Deity AI purely through behavioral changes. By enhancing the AI's decision-making capabilities in areas such as diplomacy, trade, and warfare, the mod seeks to provide a more challenging and realistic gameplay experience.

## Background
The idea for this mod was born out of the observation that AI players often make suboptimal decisions that detract from the overall gaming experience. By studying and documenting the strategies and tactics employed by human players, we can create an AI that is more competitive and engaging. This project leverages various programming languages and techniques to inject new behaviors into the game.

## On Imitation Learning
Manual development of game AI is painstaking. We'd like to try a an imitation learning alternative, that allows game AI behaviour to be learned directly from human players. Imitation Learning models are typically elite offerings, but this mod explores whether a more modest version can be integrated into game code. 

## Key Features
- **Behavior Observation**: The mod continuously observes and records human player behavior during gameplay.
- **Documentation**: Human player behavior is documented as SQL, Lua, and XML injections, providing a comprehensive dataset for analysis.
- **Behavior Translation**: The documented behaviors are translated into modifications for the Prince AI, enabling it to make more informed and strategic decisions.
- **Enhanced Decision-Making**: Improvements in AI decision-making cover multiple aspects of the game, including diplomacy, trade, and warfare.
- **Realistic Gameplay**: By mimicking human strategies, the mod aims to create a more realistic and challenging gameplay experience.

## Technical Details
- **SQL Injections**: Used to modify the game's database entries, allowing for dynamic changes in AI behavior.
- **Lua Scripting**: Employed to script complex behaviors and decision-making processes.
- **XML Modifications**: Utilized to alter game configurations and settings, ensuring that the AI can adapt to various scenarios.

## Future Plans
- **Continuous Improvement**: Ongoing updates to further refine AI behavior based on player feedback and new observations.
- **Community Involvement**: Encouraging community contributions to expand the dataset of human player behaviors and improve the mod.
- **Compatibility**: Ensuring the mod remains compatible with future game updates and expansions.
